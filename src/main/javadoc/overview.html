            User Interface
        </h2>
        <p>
            The program uses the Java Swing library to provide a user interface. Components are created in the code
            manually without any configuration files.

        <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <p>
            The Minimax algorithm was used to find the best possible moves for A.I. player. Alpha-beta pruning allows to
            omit evaluation of some game states and speeds up computation.

        <h2>Project Decomposition</h2>
        <p>
            The code is separated into two packages. One is responsible for the user interface and the other for the
            game logic and computation.
